In implementing #1 I followed the existing color stuff in `spec`/`pinocchio`.
However it's pretty silly looking (partly because I wasn't using it exactly as
intended) and could be cleaned up.

Thinking something like generating e.g. `self.red(txt, bold=True)`, but also
possibly adding colorscheme aliases like in Rudolf (e.g. `self.error(txt)` or
`self.filename(txt)`). Even if we don't implement Rudolf's color schemes, being
able to change many disparate instances of the same color to a different color
or bold level, will be useful as we tweak.
